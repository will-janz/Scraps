## badPhoneNum ##
A probably inefficient script to determine how many phone numbers would be invalidated if a certain combination of numbers was disallowed, say, for example, a number like 555-911-5555 would be invalid because it contains "911".

Practical use? Probably none, I just got bored on a road trip.
